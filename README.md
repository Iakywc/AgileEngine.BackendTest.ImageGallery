Agile Engine's Backend Excercise - Login and Retrieve Images

Unfortunatly I wasn't able to finish all that I wanted in Time. Currently the project will do nothing if run.
I miss understood and create request to get the images from AgileEngine interview URL After spending some time trying to reach that URL. 
I came back to the excercise and realize I had to setup DB and some someple files. By this point, I had already consume more he 2hs I was allowed.
So, I dicided to wrap up my original approach and atleast present the basics and showcase how I work.

Thanks a lot for reading this and looking at the code.
